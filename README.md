# VibeBar

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A Dynamic Island–style floating bar for Windows that shows all your Claude Code and Codex CLI sessions at a glance.

Hover to expand — see which projects are running, what was last asked, and how long ago. Double-click a card to jump to that VS Code window. Drag cards to reorder. Slide left or right to reposition the bar — drag it to a screen edge and it snaps back to center.

## Features

- **Live session dots** — purple pulse (running), green (idle), red (needs attention), blue (background task active)
- **Hover to expand** — per-session cards with project name, last prompt, elapsed time
- **CC / CX badges** — cards labeled CC (Claude Code, orange) or CX (Codex CLI, blue) so you always know which tool owns a session
- **Jump to window** — double-click a card to bring VS Code into focus
- **Drag to reorder** — arrange sessions by priority
- **Slide to reposition** — drag the bar left or right to move it anywhere on screen; drag to either edge and it springs back to center, position persists across restarts
- **Zero taskbar footprint** — uses `SetWindowRgn` so transparent areas pass clicks through
- **Virtual desktop aware** — follows you across Windows virtual desktops

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- Python 3.9+
- PyQt6 (`pip install PyQt6`)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and/or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)

## Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/WWeellkkiinn/vibe-bar.git
cd vibe-bar

# 2. Install dependency
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. One-time setup (writes .python-path + injects Claude Code hooks)
python install.py

# 4. Launch
# Double-click vibebar.vbs
# — or —
cscript.exe vibebar.vbs
```

To quit: **right-click double-click** anywhere on the bar.

## What `install.py` does

1. Detects your Python installation (prefers `pythonw.exe` for no-console launch)
2. Creates `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VibeBar\` for state storage
3. Writes `.python-path` (gitignored) — `vibebar.vbs` reads this at launch time, no hardcoded paths in the repo
4. Injects hooks into `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\settings.json` for these Claude Code events:

| Event | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Register session, detect primary vs subagent |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Mark session as running, record prompt |
| `Stop` / `StopFailure` | Mark session as idle |
| `PreToolUse` | Detect Bash tool activity (blue dot) |
| `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` | Clear Bash activity flag |
| `PermissionRequest` / `Notification` | Red dot — needs attention |
| `PermissionDenied` | Clear attention flag |
| `SubagentStart` / `SubagentStop` | Track background agent count (blue dot); if `agent_type` contains `codex`, record a pending rescue entry (keyed by `cwd`, expires in 10 s) so the next Codex `SessionStart` for that cwd auto-hides itself |

5. Injects hooks into `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\hooks.json` + enables `codex_hooks = true` in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\config.toml` for Codex CLI events. Hooks call `python.exe hook.py --source=codex` directly — no PowerShell wrapper needed.

| Event | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Register Codex session (CX card); auto-hidden if pre-marked as rescue agent via `SubagentStart` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | Mark running, record prompt |
| `Stop` | Mark idle, return `{"continue": true}` |
| `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure` | Bash-only — track active Bash tool, upgrade idle→running |
| `PermissionRequest` | Red dot — needs attention |

> **Note:** `install.py` is idempotent — re-running it refreshes hook paths safely without duplicating entries.

> **If you already have other hooks** for these events, `install.py` preserves them and only replaces the VibeBar entry.

## Debug mode

```powershell
# Launch with console output
python src/ui_qml.py

# Simulate hook events
echo '{"session_id":"s1","hook_event_name":"SessionStart","cwd":"C:/dev/myproject","model":"claude-opus-4-7"}' | python src/hook.py
echo '{"session_id":"s1","hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","cwd":"C:/dev/myproject","prompt":"fix the bug"}' | python src/hook.py
echo '{"session_id":"s1","hook_event_name":"Stop","cwd":"C:/dev/myproject"}' | python src/hook.py
```

State is written to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VibeBar\state.json`.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code → src/hook.py → %LOCALAPPDATA%\VibeBar\state.json → src/ui_qml.py (250ms poll)
```

```

## Development

This repo is the active development base. Branch workflow:

```powershell
git checkout -b feat/my-feature
# ... make changes ...
git push origin feat/my-feature
```

To restart after code changes:

```bash
# Git Bash
powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command "Get-Process pythonw -EA SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force"
cscript.exe vibebar.vbs
```

## Roadmap

- [x] **Codex CLI support** — CC/CX badges, separate cards per tool, shared `state.json`
- [x] **Free positioning** — drag the bar left or right, snap back to center at screen edges, position persists across restarts
- [x] **Card order memory** — drag to reorder cards; order persists across restarts (keyed by cwd)
- [x] **Smooth collapse animation** — card content fades out in the second half of collapse and fades in on expand; bottom corners stay rounded throughout via MultiEffect layer clipping
- [x] **Blue dot while Codex runs** — parent CC session stays blue until the spawned Codex process actually fires Stop, using parent_sid tracking instead of cwd heuristic
- [x] **Stale session cleanup** — primary sessions inactive for 4 h are automatically marked idle; zombie sessions no longer cause permanent blue dots
- [x] **Empty state card** — a proper card-shaped placeholder with drag support when no sessions are present
- [x] **Codex hook reliability** — direct `python.exe --source=codex` call replaces PowerShell wrapper; `readline()` fixes stdin blocking; PreToolUse/PostToolUse restricted to Bash-only to eliminate timeout storms
- [x] **`/goal` purple dot** — PreToolUse Bash upgrades idle→running so sessions started via Codex `/goal` show the correct running color
- [x] **Smooth card removal** — Win32 mask held at old size during shrink animation, eliminating the clip-before-move artifact when deleting a card
